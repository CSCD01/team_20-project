Comments:

I was very happy to see that the team came fully prepared to deliver a
professional presentation. Every team member seemed to be well
informed and actively participated in the interview.

The team introduction was done well, in a professional manner. 

The project was introduced well, including a good demonstration.

The requirement of explaining the choice of the project was, of
course, waived for you.

You presented convincing arguments for choosing the software process
and explained the process well.
