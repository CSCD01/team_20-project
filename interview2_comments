        team for your project.

I was a bit disappointed to see that you have not put in the effort to
fully prepare for the presentation. You were able to address all
points required in the demo during the interview (I could tell you
knew what you were talking about!), but as far as presentation goes, I
did not find it very effective.
You were able to answer my questions well.
The demo was satisfactory.
Your presentation did not properly address the issues of design and
implementation of the feature, but you were able to answer my
questions on the topic effectively, with the use of appropriate
diagrams.
I was happy to see that you put in the work to learn a software process
and apply the knowledge in your project. Your use of repo, Gantt charts,
waterfall artefacts were all excellent. You provided a thoughtful analysis
and retrospective of the process.
Overall, I am happy to see that you were able to produce a significant
contribution as part of the course.
