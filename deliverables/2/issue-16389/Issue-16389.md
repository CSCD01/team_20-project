# Issue
Due to the nature of the fontproperties functionality, it replaces the current font properties with the given font properties and sets the rest of the properties as defult values. This results in inconsistant functionality as it wipes out previous changes made, such as setting the size of the text. We take the merge rather than replacement as a intended functionality as other properties merge nicely such as size and also due to the fact it is considered an issue by the team. 

# Resolution
Therefore we find the solution in editing the text.py and font_manager.py in order to create the ability to merge a font property object to preserve values changed from the default, as well as using those merging capabilities for the update functionality of text.
